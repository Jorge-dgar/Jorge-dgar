## Heeey! I'm Jorge ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Developer and Consulting who loves both the world of design and technology, and my journey has given me the chance to combine these passions in creative ways. I hold two higher education degrees: the first in Personal and Corporate Image Consulting, and the second in Web Application Development.

âš¡ In my first degree, I gained valuable experience in event organization and working with corporate imagery for various companies. Although it wasn't my main focus, it helped me develop strong organizational skills and an understanding of how visuals can impact a brand's identity.

âš¡ My second degree allowed me to dive deeper into the world of web development, where I found my true passion. I specialize in HTML/CSS, Python, and Angular, with a particular love for crafting intuitive and visually appealing web interfaces. I enjoy creating seamless user experiences that are not only functional but also visually engaging.

Iâ€™m always excited to learn something new every day ðŸ’¬. Whether it's exploring the latest web technologies or enhancing my design skills, I love challenges that help me grow. Known for being fun and easy-going, I thrive in team environments where collaboration is key.

If you think Iâ€™d be a good fit for any project you have in mind, feel free to reach out! ðŸ”­ Donâ€™t forget to check out my projects and see what Iâ€™ve been working on. Looking forward to connecting! ðŸš€
